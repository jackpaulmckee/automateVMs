This is where I make notes of things that happened during the project. For future reference.


Concepts:
- familiarize myself with running bash commands in the terminal
- familiarize myself with git and github
- learn syntax of ansible, yaml, jinja, html
- ansible playbooks, variables, modules, functions, loops
- ansible roles, collections, modules, plugins
- ssh contexts, priveleges, key authentication
- APIs, SDKs
- AWS
- virtual environmets for python usage; system packages vs python packages



Actions:
- confirm VMs can ping eachother and the internet
- confirm VMs can all ssh into eachother
- generated key pair to allow for ssh key authentication
- manually serve an apache webpage 
- serve a webpage using an ansible playbook
- configure baseline hardening of servers





Problems:
- Virtual machine settings issue
    - ubuntu server could not boot bc I did not allocate enough storage to its virtual disk
    - cloned a server vm and it created a vm with an identical ip address
    - power off vs shut down guest corrupted my git repo. And could possibly do more harm than that too. Learned to use shut down guest

- link issues
    - could not use my physical host machine to be the control node bc regular windows does not support ansible as a control node
    - even though ufw was enabled, the client VM could somehow still access that server's webpage

- physical hardware limitations
    - esxi and vcenter could not both run bc my physical machine does not have enough RAM
    - im even having trouble running 2 server VMs and 1 client VM in workstation pro. Just bc my computer has only 16gb of RAM


backrefs???
file structure that happens above users and home???
Learn more about venv. When it's activated, what exactly is the difference of how files are accessed and used?
ansible collections requirements.yml grrrrrrrrrrrr
