This is where I make notes of things that happened during the project. For future reference.


Problems:
- Virtual machine settings issue
    - ubuntu server could not boot bc I did not allocate enough storage to its virtual disk

- link issues
    - could not use my physical host machine to be the control node bc regular windows does not support ansible as a control node

- physical hardware limitations
    - esxi and vcenter could not both run bc my physical machine does not have enough RAM
    - im even having trouble running 2 server VMs and 1 client VM in workstation pro. Just bc my computer has only 16gb of RAM
