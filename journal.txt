This is where I make notes of things that happened during the project. For future reference.


Concepts:
- familiarize myself with running bash commands in the terminal
- familiarize myself with git and github
- manually serve an apache webpage 
- learn syntax of ansible, yaml, jinja, html



Actions:
- confirm VMs can ping eachother and the internet
- confirm VMs can all ssh into eachother
- generated key pair to allow for ssh key authentication





Problems:
- Virtual machine settings issue
    - ubuntu server could not boot bc I did not allocate enough storage to its virtual disk
    - cloned a server vm and it created a vm with an identical ip address
    - power off vs shut down guest corrupted my git repo. And could possibly do more harm than that too. Learned to use shut down guest

- link issues
    - could not use my physical host machine to be the control node bc regular windows does not support ansible as a control node

- physical hardware limitations
    - esxi and vcenter could not both run bc my physical machine does not have enough RAM
    - im even having trouble running 2 server VMs and 1 client VM in workstation pro. Just bc my computer has only 16gb of RAM
