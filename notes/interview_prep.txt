VMware ====================================
Virtualization 101
    - ESXi client
        - manage host settings
        - monitor host metrics
        - generate logs of host metrics and events
    - vSphere client
        - create and clone and template VMs. Create VMs from the template
        - configure VMs
            - customize virtual hardware
                - cpu, storage, disk, networking, compatibility tuning
                - load an OS onto a VM using an OS ISO file from the vCenter Content Library repo
        - use tags and searching to navigate and organize my inventory
        - configured a host cluster to run vSphere High Availability (HA), Fault Tolerance (FT), and Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS)
        - browse events, browse alarms at the vCenter server level
        - edited the alarm for host cpu usage
        - edited cpu settings for shares, reservations, and limits
        - used vMotion to migrate VMs from one host to another within the cluster
        - look at performance charts of cpu usage of a host
            - Create a chart of cpu usage per VM on the host
            - create a chart of memory (active, ballooned, and compressed) per VM on the host
Odyssey
    - created and managed clusters, hosts, and VMs
    - uploaded a hypervisor ISO file of ESXi to my region's datastore
    - created a VM, mounted the ISO, installed and configured ESXi
    - added the VM to my cluster as a nested host
    - moved a host from one vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) to another VCSA
    - created a resource pool and added resources
    - updated vCenter server





monitor_stack.py
    - imports dependencies
    - configures prometheus query parameters
    - performs the query, getting data from prometheus in the form of metric series for each server instance
    - converts each metric series into a data frame (pandas library), then combines each data frame
    - plots data (cpu, memory, disk) (matplotlib library)






Networking
    - configure VLANs, subnets, routing, and switching via the CLI and by using understanding of OSI model, life of a data packet
        - ROAS, trunk ports, access ports, variable length subnet masking,
        - on interfaces: ip address, speed, duplex, port, description, enabling/disabling interfaces
        - life of a packet: ARP requests/replies, MAC address tables















Why do I want to be here?
    - SRE position
        - I love the complexity and dimensions within dimensions of:
            - SDLC, coding
            - virtualization
            - datacenter management
        - I love the overall responsibility: ensure optimal performance of critical systems
        - I love the potential for interdisciplinary tasks. 
        - it seems like there is infinite room for growth
        - the technologies are interesting to me plain and simple
        - getting to know much better how the infrastructure works; that I've been working with and looking at
        - combines the mindsets of my previous work experience
        - this kind of work suits me well. Coding, virtualization, datacenter infrastructe. I can do this all day every day

Future plans:
    - home lab:
        - more VMware labs (networking, automation, esxtop)
        - run more testing and data collection of computer metrics
        - set up an environment where servers will be monitored, alerted on, investigated, and fixed
        - containerize the git repo that i built
    - skills:
        - direct B team training and contribution
        - SRE textbook
        - SRE bootcamp
        - certifications
        - home lab
