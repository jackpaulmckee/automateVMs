ansible was installed globally and being used from that location. Had to get a version of ansible into my venv. 
    - but then "which ansible" was showing the version of ansible within the venv; while "ansible --version" was still showing as global location. Need to use "hash -r"

ok now where is my amazon.aws ansible collection located? How can I get this into my venv requirements?
    - for collections and potentially other things, the developer needs to create a separate collections/requirements.yml

ansible playbooks vs inventories

i could ssh into the instances of ec2. But i could not ping them from ansible
    - Tough troubleshooting but it made sense after learning the diff between host keys and ssh keys. 
        - unfortunately you cant automate host key checking of new hosts via ssh. So i turned host key checking off, which is safe for my lab

I GOT ANSIBLE TO PING MY EC2 INSTANCES LETS GOOOOOO

while it's fresh in my mind, I pieced together my rough draft of a setup shell script into a an actual usable script.
    - i want my project to be conveniently repeatable and as automated as possible
get ansible collections location understood and added to ansible.cfg and .gitignore
