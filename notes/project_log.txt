ansible was installed globally and being used from that location. Had to get a version of ansible into my venv. 
    - but then "which ansible" was showing the version of ansible within the venv; while "ansible --version" was still showing as global location. Need to use "hash -r"

ok now where is my amazon.aws ansible collection located? How can I get this into my venv requirements?
    - for collections and potentially other things, the developer needs to create a separate collections/requirements.yml

ansible playbooks vs inventories
created a dynamic inventory for AWS servers

i could ssh into the instances of ec2. But i could not ping them from ansible
    - Tough troubleshooting but it made sense after learning the diff between host keys and ssh keys. 
        - unfortunately you cant automate host key checking of new hosts via ssh. So i turned host key checking off, which is safe for my lab

I GOT ANSIBLE TO PING MY EC2 INSTANCES LETS GOOOOOO

while it's fresh in my mind, I created and actual usable nice looking setup shell script, from the rough draft bits and pieces that I kept track of
    - i want my project to be conveniently repeatable and as automated as possible
get ansible collections location understood and added to ansible.cfg and .gitignore

browsed through ESXi host client
used vSphere client to:
    - change settings on an existing VM
    - create a new VM that is tuned for a particular OS and install that OS (photon OS)
    - create a VM template from an existing VM, then create a new VM from that template
    - use tags and searching to navigate and organize my inventory
    - configured a host cluster to run vSphere High Availability (HA) and vSphere Fault Tolerance (FT)
    - reconfigured existing alarm for CPU usage. Created new alarm for VM CPU ready time. Both are set at the vCenter server level
    - disable Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) and use vMotion to migrate VMs from one host to another within the cluster
    - monitor the performance of a host and create custom charts
    - install and configure ESXi
