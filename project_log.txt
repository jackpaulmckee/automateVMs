- ansible was installed globally and being used from that location. Had to get a version of ansible into my venv. 
    - but then "which ansible" was showing the version of ansible within the venv; while "ansible --version" was still showing as global location. Need to use "hash -r"
- ok now where is my amazon.aws ansible collection located? How can I get this into my venv requirements?
    - for collections and potentially other things, the developer needs to create a separate collections/requirements.yml
